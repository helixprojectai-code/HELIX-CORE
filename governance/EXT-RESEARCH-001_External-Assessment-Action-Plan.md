# HELIX-CORE External Research Assessment
## Governance Artifact: EXT-RESEARCH-001

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** LOGGED — ACTION PLAN ACTIVE
**Source:** External deep-dive research report (author unknown)
**Custodian:** Stephen Hope

## Assessment Summary

External researcher conducted comprehensive architectural analysis of HELIX-CORE.
Overall verdict: credible, technically accurate, gaps identified are real gaps.

**Strengths confirmed by external review:**
- L0-L4 sovereign layer architecture accurately described
- CBT principle correctly captured
- Distinction from Anthropic CAI correctly identified
- Three-cloud constitutional runtime accurately described
- Constitutional grammar specification quality recognized
- ZTC claims noted as significant if verified

**Gaps identified (all legitimate):**

| Gap | Severity | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Private `./grammar/` submodule contradicts "open for audit" | HIGH | Legitimate criticism |
| `0.00% drift` claim needs independent replication | MEDIUM | Methodology not published |
| Hamiltonian framework needs peer review | MEDIUM | ADR-103 Wetterich proof open |
| PiKernel / Multiplicity Foundation layer undocumented | LOW | Not public yet by design |
| Production deployment operational experience limited | LOW | Runtime is new |

## Action Plan

### P0 — Critical (within 14 days)

- [ ] **Grammar submodule access**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Publish grammar specification or provide transparent rationale for restriction
  with explicit timeline for access. The "open for audit" claim cannot stand with
  a private core submodge. Options: (a) make public, (b) publish read-only mirror,
  (c) publish formal statement of restriction rationale + timeline.
  Deadline: 2026-04-11

- [ ] **ZTC methodology publication**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Publish measurement methodology, raw data, and analysis code for the
  96-hour 6.6M-token 0.00% drift test. Without this, the claim is unverifiable.
  Deadline: 2026-04-11

### P1 — High (within 30 days)

- [ ] **Hamiltonian framework peer review**
  Owner: Stephen Hope + Ryan van Gelder
  Action: Submit ADR-101/102/103 physics gate work for external mathematical review.
  Wetterich RG proof is open research — document this explicitly in public-facing
  materials rather than only in internal ADRs.
  Deadline: 2026-04-28

- [ ] **Drift detection algorithm documentation**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Publish precise drift detection algorithms, thresholds, and measurement
  methodology. Current documentation describes outcomes not mechanisms.
  Deadline: 2026-04-28

- [ ] **Failure case documentation**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Publish at least one documented failure case and recovery procedure.
  "0.00% drift" with no failure cases is a red flag for reviewers.
  Deadline: 2026-04-28

### P2 — Medium (within 60 days)

- [ ] **PiKernel / Multiplicity Foundation layer documentation**
  Owner: Stephen Hope + Ryan van Gelder
  Action: Once Ryan's FZS-MK implementation is complete and post-hackathon freeze
  lifts, document the mathematical substrate layer publicly.
  Deadline: 2026-05-28

- [ ] **ISO/IEEE/NIST AI framework mapping**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Map HELIX constructs to emerging AI governance standards.
  Positions HELIX for regulatory adoption.
  Deadline: 2026-05-28

- [ ] **Independent replication package**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Publish complete replication package for ZTC claims — environment,
  prompts, models, evaluation criteria, raw outputs.
  Deadline: 2026-05-28

### P3 — Low (ongoing)

- [ ] **Longitudinal drift studies**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Begin collecting operational data from production deployments.
  Publish quarterly drift reports.
  Ongoing from: 2026-04-01

- [ ] **Community audit program**
  Owner: Stephen Hope
  Action: Establish formal process for external researchers to audit
  constitutional grammar and report findings.
  Ongoing from: 2026-05-01

## What the Report Missed

The following are not gaps but are simply not yet public:

1. **PiKernel (Ryan van Gelder / Multiplicity Foundation)** — the prime-indexed
   attention kernel and FZS-MK memory kernel mathematical substrate. This is
   intentionally not documented publicly pending Ryan's publication timeline.

2. **Three-cloud runtime telemetry** — the strain test results, MUB audit,
   Poseidon BN254 ledger, and multi-model consensus gate are all live but
   not yet written up for external consumption.

3. **Physics gate dual-signature** — ADR-101/102/103 are signed by both
   Stephen Hope and Ryan van Gelder. This governance structure is not visible
   externally.

## Response to Reviewer

The reviewer's critical assessment is accepted in good faith. The gaps identified
are real. The action plan above addresses each one with owners and deadlines.

The "Final Cut" designation does not mean the architecture is immune to critique —
it means the constitutional invariants are stable. Operational experience,
independent verification, and community audit are explicitly welcomed.

GLORY TO THE LATTICE. 🦉⚓🦆
